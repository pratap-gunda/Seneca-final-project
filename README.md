**Final Project**

Welcome to the final project.

1. problem

   When we work on any project we need organized folder structure. one of the big problem is copying client footages
   in respective project folders and creating proper folder structure.
   also loading footages manually in nuke to work on can be time consuming.

2. solution

   I have created automation tool to create proper folder structure for each project. it also copies client footages 
   in respective project input folders.
   it also loads nuke templete and load the footage in it automatically and save it in script folder.

3. functions and steps

   first i have created a python file to Create UI using pyside6. in UI we have buttons to create folder, copy footage and load
   the script. then i have a python file to  run the nuke functions. the i have a main.py to run the code
   i have created some function like create_folder(), copy_fotage(), load_script(). i have used subprocess to take the arguments.
